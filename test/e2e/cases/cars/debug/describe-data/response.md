  "data_format": "The data is structured as a JSON array, where each entry is a JSON object with fields detailing the car's specifications. Key fields include 'Name', 'Miles_per_Gallon', 'Cylinders', 'Displacement', 'Horsepower', 'Weight_in_lbs', 'Acceleration', 'Year', and 'Origin'. Note that 'Miles_per_Gallon' can have null values, implying missing data which may require preprocessing, such as imputation, before analysis. Entries are grouped by the year and origin but not sorted in any particular order within those groups.",
