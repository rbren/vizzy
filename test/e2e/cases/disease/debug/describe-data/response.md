  "data_format": "The data is provided in CSV format, with each row representing a different cause of death, such as 'alzheimers', 'cancer', and 'heart_disease'. The columns are 'cod' for the cause of death, and then four columns for different sources: 'cdc' for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, 'google' for Google search trends, 'guardian' for The Guardian newspaper, and 'nyt' for The New York Times. These columns represent some measure of attention or coverage by each of these sources, possibly normalized but the exact metric isn't specified here. It is important to treat the data with caution before analysis, ensuring proper normalization and understanding of what each value represents. Special preprocessing might include normalization if the different sources use different scales.",
