  "data_format": "The data is structured as a CSV with the first row serving as headers for each column. Each subsequent row represents a different cause of death. The columns are named for four different sources: `cod` for the cause of death, `cdc` for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, `google` for Google search volume, `guardian` for The Guardian newspaper, and `nyt` for The New York Times. Each cell in the `cdc`, `google`, `guardian`, and `nyt` columns contains a numerical value representing the frequency or volume of reporting or interest for that cause of death. When analyzing this data, one may need to normalize these values across the different sources to make meaningful comparisons.",

    "Create a bar graph comparing CDC reported death rates with media coverage for each cause of death.",

    "Draw a line graph illustrating the trend of media coverage over time for a selected cause of death, if temporal data is provided in the full dataset."
