  "data_format": "This JSON file begins with a top-level object containing metadata fields 'total', 'limit', and 'start', followed by a 'data' array. Each element of the 'data' array is an object that corresponds to a specific national park, with fields providing descriptive details such as 'id', 'url', 'fullName', 'parkCode', 'description', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'activities', 'topics', and more. Nested within some of these fields are arrays of objects, such as 'activities' and 'topics', each with their own descriptive fields. Special preprocessing considerations might include parsing the nested structures for detailed analyses, handling missing fields like 'entranceFees' arrays, and geospatial processing for the coordinates.",
