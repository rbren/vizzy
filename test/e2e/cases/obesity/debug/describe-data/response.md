  "description": "Contains obesity rates by U.S. state along with geographic shape data",
  "data_format": "The data is structured as a CSV file with fields for state ID (`FID`), state name (`NAME`), obesity rate (`Obesity`), and geographic information including `SHAPE_Length` and `SHAPE_Area`. Each row represents a U.S. state or territory. Note that the obesity rate is expressed as a percentage. The geographical shape data (`SHAPE_Length` for the perimeter length and `SHAPE_Area` for the total area) seems to be provided in some units not specified here, and special consideration should be given when dealing with the `SHAP_Length` and `SHAPE_Area` for `Hawaii` as its values are listed as `0`, indicating missing or inapplicable data. This suggests the need for preprocessing steps like handling missing values or converting units as per analysis requirements.",
