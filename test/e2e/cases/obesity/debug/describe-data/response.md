  "description": "Contains obesity rates by U.S. state along with geographic information.",
  "data_format": "The data is structured as a CSV file with headers indicating each column's purpose. Each row represents a different U.S. state or territory and includes its FID (unique identifier), NAME (the state or territory's name), Obesity rate (percentage of the population classified as obese), SHAPE_Length (a geographical measure related to the state's boundary), and SHAPE_Area (the total area of the state). Prior to analysis, data scientists might want to convert the 'Obesity' field from string to float for numerical calculations and 'SHAPE_Length' and 'SHAPE_Area' from string to float or double, depending on the needed precision. The FID could be used as a primary key if merging this data with other data sources.",
