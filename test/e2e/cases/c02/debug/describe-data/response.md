  "description": "Contains monthly measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, both unadjusted and adjusted values.",
  "data_format": "The data is in a CSV format, with each row representing a monthly measurement of CO2. There are three columns in the data: `Date`, `CO2`, and `adjusted CO2`. The 'Date' field is formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, though only year and month are significant since the day is always set to the first of the month. The `CO2` and `adjusted CO2` fields contain floating point numbers representing the measured and adjusted values of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm). Before analyzing this data, it might be necessary to parse the date fields into a date/time representation suitable for time series analysis. Furthermore, handling missing data points (for example, there appears to be no entries for certain months) may be required for comprehensive analysis.",

    "Create a year-over-year change heatmap to visualize how CO2 concentrations change each year"
