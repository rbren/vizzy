  "data_format": "The data is structured as a CSV file. Each row represents a monthly measurement with three fields: `Date`, `CO2`, and `adjusted CO2`. The `Date` field denotes the year and month of the measurement. The `CO2` field contains the atmospheric CO2 concentration measured in parts per million (ppm). The `adjusted CO2` field consists of the CO2 concentrations adjusted for seasonal variations. To analyze this data, it is recommended to parse the date fields appropriately and handle missing values or outliers if any are present.",
