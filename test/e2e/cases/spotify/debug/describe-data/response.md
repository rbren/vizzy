  "description": "Tracks the popularity of various music genres over multiple dates spanning from April 23, 2016 to August 9, 2023.",
  "data_format": "The data is structured as a CSV where each row represents a music genre and each column represents a date. The first row contains the column headers, which are dates in MM/DD/YYYY format starting from '4/23/2016' and ending with '8/9/2023'. Each subsequent row starts with the genre name followed by the popularity scores (or rankings) of that genre on each date. Scores are numeric. Some cells in the table are empty, indicating missing data points for those genre-date combinations. Preprocessing steps might include filling missing values and converting date strings into a date-time format for time series analysis.",
