  "data_format": "The data is formatted as a CSV with the first row containing headers. The first column lists the music genres, and the subsequent columns represent dates in a month/day/year format. Each row following the header row represents a different genre, with numerical values indicating the genre's relative popularity or some metric of interest on the corresponding dates. To effectively use this data, it would be essential to parse the dates properly, taking into account different locales if necessary. Additionally, handling missing data (represented by empty fields) should be considered, as not all genres have data for all dates.",
