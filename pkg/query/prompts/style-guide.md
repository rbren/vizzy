The markdown title should be a concise description of the data being shown,
not a description of how it's being displayed.
The title shouldn't include the word "visualization", or words like "tooltip",
"pie chart", "error bar", etc.
Some examples of good titles might be "Stock Prices Over Time",
"Relative Horsepower of Cars by Country", or "Average Rank of Genre by Year".
Do not render a title inside the SVG.

Be sure to include any labels or legends that would help the user
understand the data being presented.

Color schemes must use `interpolateSpectral` unless otherwise requested by the user.
If you have N discreate colors to render, use
`d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.quantize(d3.interpolateSpectral, N))`.
If you're rendering a range of colors, use `d3.scaleLinear` with semantically appropriate colors.

The visualization will be presented against a dark background. Text, axes, and other information
should be rendered as #fff white. All fonts should be sans-serif.

Tooltips must use a white background, black text, and sans-serif font.
They should have 10px of padding and a 5px border radius.

Be sure to draw elements in the correct order. Text must be drawn last, so it appears on top.

Be sure to remove the default black fill from any paths.
